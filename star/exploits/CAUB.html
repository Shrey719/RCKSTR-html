    this method (originally found by Catakang#0987) will help you keep your
    chromebook downgraded (or on the current version) without automatic updates
    screwing you over using onc files, you can convince your chromebook that the
    wifi that you're connected to is pay-to-use (like a hotspot using data), and
    thus it will not check for updates

    <b>i cannot guarantee that this will work on every wifi</b>

    <hr />
    <b>to start:</b>

    - go to chrome://network#state (on your school chromebook of course; if this
    is blocked then ur kinda screwed lol) - scroll to the bottom of the page;
    you should see a list of "favorite" wifis that you've connected to in the
    past

    <b
      >repeat the following steps for each network that you commonly connect
      your chromebook to: (yes, this works for managed school wifis too)</b
    >

    - click the + sign next to the wifi name - copy all the data that appears -
    go back to this page (caub.glitch.me) - using the menu below, create
    textboxes and paste data for one network in each box - press the "generate
    onc" button below the textboxes

    <hr />
    <input placeholder="read instructions!" /><button onclick="add(this)">
      +</button
    ><button onclick="subtract()">-</button>

    <button onclick="gen()"><b>generate and download onc file</b></button>
    <hr />
    - once you have downloaded the file, go to chrome://network#general - click
    on the "import onc" button - import the newly downloaded file

    <b
      >your chromebook will no longer automatically update (as long as you are
      on a wifi that you used caub on) be careful not to stay on a wifi for too
      long without using caub on it</b
